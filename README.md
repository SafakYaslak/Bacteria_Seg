# Bacteria_Seg
The project uses computer vision techniques to automatically detect and segment bacteria. Thanks to the combination of YOLOv8 and SAM2 models, the shapes and features of bacteria are analyzed in detail and presented to users. The project's web interface was developed with the Flask framework to provide a user-friendly experience.

# Models:
# YOLOv8
Ultralytics' YOLOv8 model was trained with approximately 5,000 bacterial images. In the project, 80% was accepted as the minimum accuracy value.
# SAM2
Meta's newly released SAM2 segmentation model provides detailed segmentation by precisely determining object boundaries.

# Data Set:
The data set used within the scope of the project was obtained from Roboflow. The data set was integrated into the model using the API. You can find more information about the dataset we used and the dataset itself at the link below:
